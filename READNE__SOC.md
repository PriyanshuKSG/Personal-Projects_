In SOC so far I have explored many libraries in python such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and currently in this week we have started 
basics of Machine Learning which will help me to understand both the theory and code/implementation of various algorithms 
which come under Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. So far the actual coding of the project has not bben started.
